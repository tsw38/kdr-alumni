Getting Started
---------------

This theme was built utilizing [underscore](https://underscores.me) theme templating.
The styling is with sass/compass

Since this is just the theme and the plugins directory follow these steps to setup a functional theme

* clone the repo to `wp-content/themes`
* symlink the plugins directory to `wp-content` by running this command in wp-content: `ln -s ./themes/kdr-alumni/plugins`
* Install [compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) to compile stylesheets
* watch the stylesheets by running this command from the theme directory: `compass watch styles/sass/styles.scss`
* test user is alumni_kdr/hodes
